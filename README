*  =======================================*
*
*	Simple QML Component that authenticates your users using Facebook Graph.
*
*
*/

Usage:


* Use like any file component. Facebook application id property is required:

    Facebook {
        id: facebook

        displayStyle: "touch" // or "wap"
        applicationId: "<YOUR FB APP ID HERE>"
	scope: ["user_aboute_me", "friends_about_me"] // Application permissions

	onUserAuthenticated: {
            myGraph(function() {
		main.name = this["name"];
	    });
        }      
    }


* Some properties you can hook into:

    facebook.isAuthenticated	        => returns if user is authenticated or not (bool)
    facebook.userId			=> returns user facebook id
    facebook.token			=> returns user facebook token
    facebook.me				=> returns your facebook graph data (variant) so you can do things like, text: facebook.me.name

* Some functions you can use:
 
    facebook.myPicture() 		=> returns your picture url

* Access functions to graph are not done yet, but you can use getJSON helper from helpers.js if you really need something else.


Thank you.
